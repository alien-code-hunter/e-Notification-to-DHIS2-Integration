# Sandbox Environment Policies

- **Rate Limit:** 1000 requests per hour per API key.
- **Data Reset:** All test data will be wiped every Monday at 00:00 UTC. Or we can. leave them alone to test reporting. 
- **Data Privacy:** No real patient data should be used in the sandbox. If OPM have a testing server with dis-identified data, that would be great
- **Test Credentials:** I will provide these when the sandbox sytem is set up
- **Webhook Testing:** Use https://webhook.site I will also provide this.
